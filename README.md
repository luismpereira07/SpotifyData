# SpotifyAnalysis
 
This analysis was done based on Spotify Wrapped sessions released every year by their users. The database used was my own music data + Kaggle database available on https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks.

The analysis were done initially using Microsoft Power BI and then using Pythhon libraries, as attached. 

The final results are available in my article in LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-spotify-knows-your-feelings-almost-exploratory-data-martins/
